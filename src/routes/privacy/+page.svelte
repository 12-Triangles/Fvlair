    However, when you visit or interact with our sites, services, applications,
    tools or messaging, we or our authorized service providers may use cookies,
    web beacons, and other similar technologies to make your experience better,
    faster and safer, for advertising purposes and to allow us to continuously
    improve our sites, services, applications and tools. Any personal
    information or data collected by these technologies is used only by us or by
    our authorized service providers on our behalf.

  <div class="section">
    What are cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies
  </div>
  <br />

  <div class="body-text">
    These technologies are essentially small data files placed on your computer,
    tablet, mobile phone or other device (“collectively, a “device”) that allows
    us to record information when you visit or interact with our websites,
    service, applications, messaging, and other tools. Though often these
    technologies are generically referred to as “Cookies,” each functions
    slightly differently, and is better explained below:
    <br />
    <br />

    <b>Cookies:</b>
    Cookies are small (often encrypted) text files placed in the memory of your
    web browser or device when you visit a website or view a message. Cookies
    allow a website to recognize a particular device or browser. There are
    several types of cookies:
    <br />
    <br />
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>Session cookies</em>
        expire at the end of your browser session and allow us to link your
        actions during that particular browser session.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Persistent cookies</em>
        are stored on your device in between browser sessions, allowing us to
        remember your preferences or actions across multiple sites.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>First-party cookies</em>
        are those set by a website that is being visited by the user at the time
        in order to preserve your settings (e.g., while on our site).
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Third-party cookies</em>
        are placed in your browser by a website, or domain, that is not the
        website or domain that you are currently visiting. If a user visits a
        website and another entity sets a cookie through that website this would
        be a third-party cookie.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    Cookies are used for a variety of purposes on our website. For example, they
    store information that allows us to present our site in your local language,
    or prices in local currency. They also communicate data to our servers when
    you visit our site, allowing you to stay logged in to your account during
    your visit or maintain the site preferences you set. Preventing your browser
    from accepting 1st party cookies will prevent the placement of some cookies
    that are classified as “Essential”.
    <br />
    <br />

    <b>Web beacons (pixels):</b>
    A web beacon (also called “tracking pixels” or “image tags”) is a small file
    (most often a transparent, 1x1 GIF file) that loaded on our web pages. These
    pixels may work in concert with cookies to collect information about your
    visit, your web browser/device, browsing activity, or onsite behavior and
    provide that information to service providers. Pixels are most commonly used
    to collect anonymous traffic metrics (page visits, button clicks, order
    completion) used to analyze site performance.
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>Scripts:</b>
    A script is a small piece of website code placed on our websites to power
    customer service tools like live chat, allow for the delivery of video
    tutorials in our help section, and allow us to provide interactive
    experiences to visitors. They are also used to collect data that we use for
    website analytics, or to provide data on the effectiveness of our
    advertising.
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>Similar technologies:</b>
    Technologies that store information in your browser or device utilizing
    local shared objects or local storage, such as HTML 5 cookies, and other web
    application software methods. These technologies can operate across all of
    your browsers. In some instances, these technologies may not be fully
    managed by your browser and may require management directly through your
    installed applications or device. We do not use these technologies for
    storing information to target advertising to you on or off our sites.
  </div>
  <br />

  <div class="section">What technologies do we use and why</div>
  <br />

  <div>
    Our cookies, web beacons and similar technologies serve various purposes,
    but generally they (1) are necessary or essential to the functioning of our
    sites, services, applications, tools or messaging, (2) help us improve the
    performance of or provide you extra functionality of the same, (3) help us
    to serve relevant and targeted advertisements, or (4) allow us to offer
    support tools that you utilize to interact with our care guides:
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>Strictly Necessary or Essential:</b>
    "Strictly necessary" or “essential” cookies, web beacons and similar
    technologies let you move around the website and use essential features like
    secure areas and shopping baskets. Without these technologies, services you
    have asked for cannot be provided. Please note that these technologies do
    not gather any information about you that could be used for marketing or
    remembering where you've been on the internet. Accepting these technologies
    is a condition of using our sites, services, applications, tools or
    messaging, so if you utilize tools that might prevent these from loading, we
    can't guarantee your use or how the security therein will perform during
    your visit.
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>Performance:</b>
    Performance technologies may include first or third-party cookies, web
    beacons/pixels, and scripts placed in order to gather information about how
    you use our website (pages you visit, if you experience any errors, load
    times). These cookies do not collect any information that could identify you
    and are only used to help us improve how our website works, understand the
    interests of our users, and measure how effective our content is by
    providing anonymous statistics and data regarding how our website is used.
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>Advertising:</b>
    Advertising technology may include first or third-party cookies, web
    beacons/pixels, and scripts placed in order to gather information on the
    effectiveness of our marketing efforts, deliver personalized content, or to
    generate data that allows for the delivery of advertising relevant to your
    specific interests on our sites, as well as third-party websites. We also
    utilize 3rd party service providers to assist us in delivering on the same
    functions, which means that our authorized service providers may also place
    cookies, web beacons and similar technologies on your device via our
    services (first and third party cookies). They may also collect information
    that helps them identify your device, such as IP address, or other unique or
    device identifiers.
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>Support:</b>
    Support technologies may include first or third-party cookies, web beacons /
    pixels, and scripts placed in order to provide tools for you to interact
    with our customer support teams. This technology allows us to provide chat
    services, gather customer feedback, and other tools used to support our
    visitors. Data collected for these purposes is never used for marketing or
    advertising purposes.
