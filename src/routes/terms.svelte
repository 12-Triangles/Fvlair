  The entire contents displayed on the Website and Application (and any
  derivative works or enhancements of the same) including, but not limited to,
  all text, fonts, illustrations, files, images, software, scripts, graphics,
  photos, sounds, music, videos, information, content, materials, products,
  services, URLs, technology, documentation, and interactive features included
  with or available through our Services (collectively, the “Service Content”)
  and all intellectual property rights to the same are owned by us, our
  licensors, or both. Additionally, all trademarks, service marks, trade names
  and trade dress that may appear in our Services are owned by us, our
  licensors, or identified third parties. All Service Content have copyright
  protection as a collective work under the laws of the United States and other
  copyright laws and, except for the limited use rights granted to you in these
  Terms of Use, you shall not acquire any right, title or interest in our
  Services or any Service Content. You are allowed to display and, subject to
  any expressly stated restrictions or limitations relating to specific
  material, download portions of the Service Content from the different areas of
  the Website and/or Application only for non-commercial use, unless otherwise
  permitted. Any redistribution, retransmission or publication of any
  copyrighted material is strictly prohibited without the express written
  permission of the copyright owner. You agree not to use any of our logos or

<div class="section">3. ACCESS AND USE</div>
<br />
<div>
  (A) Our Services are provided for your personal and commercial use except when
  our Service Content is used to create end products for sale where the lifetime
  sales of the end product for sale exceeds 400 units. An end product for sale
  can be either a digital design or physical item created using our Services
  that you and/or your client intends to sell (an “End Product”). You understand
  and agree that End Products you create using our Service Content must be a
  unique implementation of the Service Content, significantly different than the
  original piece of Service Content and require time, effort, and skill to
  produce. For example, if you incorporate the Service Content into sticker or
  sticker pack that you design and sell to multiple people, that is considered
  an End Product. End Products must not be used or sold in a way that is
  directly competitive with the Service Content. End Products must not
  redistribute the Service Content to any third parties in a manner that allows
  for the extraction of the Service Content. We may offer certain portions of
  our Services at no charge and others for a one-time fee, on a subscription
  basis or under any other lawful pricing structure. In all instances, our
  Services are not being sold to you; rather, subject to these Terms of Use, and

  (C) Furthermore, except as expressly permitted in these Terms of Use, you may
  not:
</div>

<div>
  (i) remove, alter, cover, or distort any copyright, trademark, or other
  proprietary rights notice we include in or through our Services or Service
  Content; (ii) circumvent, disable or otherwise interfere with our
  security-related features including, without limitation, any features that
  prevent or restrict the use of or copying of any software or other Service
  Content; (iii) use an automatic device (such as a robot or spider) or manual
  process to copy or “scrape” the Website or Service Content for any purpose
  without our express written permission; (iv) collect or harvest any personally
  identifiable information from our Services including, without limitation, user
  names, passwords, email addresses; (v) solicit other users to join or become

  person’s Membership; (x) violate U.S. export laws, including, without
  limitation, violations of the Export Administration Act and the Export

  and/or use the Services; (iv) you will not use any software or services in
  conjunction with the Service or authorized third-party software which modifies
  or reroutes, or attempts to modify or reroute, the Service; (v) you will not
  authorize any third party to access and/or use the Service on your behalf
  using any automated process such as a BOT, a spider or periodic caching of
  information stored by the Service on your behalf without a separate written
  agreement with us; (vi) you will not use any software or hardware that reduces
  the number of Users directly accessing or using the Service (sometimes called
  'multiplexing' or 'pooling' software or hardware); (vii) you will not lend,
  lease, rent or sublicense the Application; (viii) you will permit us to send
  and deliver updates and notifications to you as part of your use of the

<br />
<div>
  You agree that your Payment Method may be charged by 12 Triangles, LLC. and
  subject to the provisions of our Privacy Policy.
</div>
<br />
<div>
  (A) GENERAL TERMS, INCLUDING AUTOMATIC RENEWAL TERMS. Payment Due at Time of
  Order; Non-Refundable. You agree to pay all amounts due for Services at the
  time you order them. All amounts are non-refundable unless otherwise noted in
  the
  <a
    href="https://www.notion.so/Requesting-a-Refund-a66e34a9b22f439b89cad92865b246ff">
    Refund Policy
  </a>
  .
</div>
<br />
<div>
  Price Changes. Company reserves the right to change its prices and fees at any
  time, and such changes shall be posted online at this website and effective
  immediately without need for further notice to you. If you have purchased or
  obtained Services for a period of months or years, changes in prices and fees
  shall be effective when the Services in question come up for renewal as
  further described below.
</div>
<br />
<div>
  Payment Types. Except as prohibited in any product-specific agreement, you may
  pay for Services by using a valid credit card, provided by either Visa,
  Mastercard, Amex, or Discover each a “Payment Method”. The “Express Checkout”
  feature automatically places an order for the applicable Service and charges
  the default Express Checkout Payment Method for your Account. Confirmation of
  that order will be sent to the email address on file for your Account. Your
  Payment Method on file must be kept valid if you have any active Services in
  your Account. In addition, you agree that the location for the processing of
  your payments may change for any reason, including the type of Payment Method
  chosen, the currency selected, or changes or updates made to your Payment
  Method.
</div>
<br />
<div>
  Refunds Issued. You agree that where refunds are issued to your Payment
  Method, Company’s issuance of a refund receipt is only confirmation that
  Company has submitted your refund to the Payment Method charged at the time of
  the original sale, and that Company has no control over when the refund will
  be applied towards your Payment Method’s available balance. You further
  acknowledge and agree that the payment provider and/or individual issuing bank
  associated with your Payment Method establish and regulate the time frames for
  posting your refund, and that such refund posting time frames may range from
  five (5) business days to a full billing cycle, or longer.
</div>
<br />
<div>
  In the event a refund is issued to your Payment Method and the payment
  provider, payment processor or individual issuing bank associated with your
  Payment Method imposes any limitations on refunds, including but not limited
  to, limitations as to the timing of the refund or the number of refunds
  allowed, then Company, in its sole and absolute discretion, reserves the right
  to issue the refund either (i) in the form of an in-store credit; (ii) via
  issuance of a Company check, which will be sent to the mailing address on file
  for your Account; or (iii) in some jurisdictions, as a bank transfer, when the
  payment processor cannot refund back to the Payment Method. Company also has
  the right to offer an in-store credit for customers seeking refunds, even if
  there are no limitations on refunds imposed by the Payment Method.
</div>
<br />
<div>
  Monthly Billing Date. If you are being billed on a monthly basis, your monthly
  billing date will be based on the date of the month you purchased the
  Services, unless that date falls after the 28th of the month, in which case
  your billing date will be the 28th of each month.
</div>
<br />
<div>
  Auto-Renewal Terms. Other than as required by applicable law, Company does not
  retain hard copies or electronic versions of mandate, standing order or
  standing instruction forms and/or any signed consents relating to your usage
  of our automatic renewal services, and we are therefore unable to provide any
  such document upon request. You may view or change your automatic renewal
  settings at any time by logging into your Company account.
</div>
<br />
<div>
  IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT YOU DO NOT EXPERIENCE AN INTERRUPTION OR LOSS OF
  SERVICES, ALL SERVICES ARE OFFERED ON AUTOMATIC RENEWAL. EXCEPT FOR REASONS
  DESCRIBED BELOW IN THIS SECTION, AUTOMATIC RENEWAL AUTOMATICALLY RENEWS THE
  APPLICABLE SERVICE UPON EXPIRATION OF THE THEN CURRENT TERM FOR A RENEWAL
  PERIOD EQUAL IN TIME TO THE MOST RECENT SERVICE PERIOD. FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOUR
  LAST SERVICE PERIOD IS FOR ONE YEAR, YOUR RENEWAL PERIOD WILL TYPICALLY BE FOR
  ONE YEAR. HOWEVER, IN THE EVENT RENEWAL WITH THE PAYMENT METHOD ON FILE FAILS,
  COMPANY MAY ATTEMPT TO RENEW THE APPLICABLE SERVICE FOR A PERIOD LESS THAN THE
  ORIGINAL SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY FOR THE TRANSACTION TO
  SUCCEED.
</div>
<br />
<div>
  UNLESS YOU DISABLE THE AUTOMATIC RENEWAL OPTION, COMPANY WILL AUTOMATICALLY
  RENEW THE APPLICABLE SERVICE WHEN IT COMES UP FOR RENEWAL AND WILL TAKE
  PAYMENT FROM THE PAYMENT METHOD ASSOCIATED WITH THE SERVICE(S) IN YOUR ACCOUNT
  OR YOUR DESIGNATED BACKUP PAYMENT METHOD(S) ON FILE WITH COMPANY. IN
  AUTOMATICALLY RENEWING YOUR SERVICES, COMPANY WILL FIRST ATTEMPT TO CHARGE THE
  PAYMENT METHOD ASSOCIATED WITH THE SERVICE(S) IN YOUR ACCOUNT. IN THE EVENT
  COMPANY CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY CHARGE THIS PAYMENT METHOD, WE WILL ATTEMPT TO
  CHARGE THE PAYMENT METHOD(S) DESIGNATED AS "BACKUP" IN YOUR ACCOUNT. RENEWALS
  WILL BE CHARGED AT COMPANY’S THEN CURRENT RATES, WHICH YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND
  AGREE MAY BE HIGHER OR LOWER THAN THE RATES FOR THE ORIGINAL SERVICE PERIOD.
  IN ORDER TO SEE THE RENEWAL SETTINGS APPLICABLE TO YOU AND YOUR SERVICES,
  SIMPLY LOG INTO YOUR ACCOUNT MANAGER FROM THIS SITE AND FOLLOW THE STEPS FOUND
  HERE. IF YOU DO NOT WISH FOR ANY SERVICE TO AUTOMATICALLY RENEW, YOU MAY ELECT
  TO CANCEL RENEWAL, IN WHICH CASE, YOUR SERVICES WILL TERMINATE UPON EXPIRATION
  OF THE THEN CURRENT TERM, UNLESS YOU MANUALLY RENEW YOUR SERVICES PRIOR TO
  THAT DATE. IN OTHER WORDS, SHOULD YOU ELECT TO CANCEL YOUR PRODUCT AND FAIL TO
  MANUALLY RENEW YOUR SERVICES BEFORE THEY EXPIRE, YOU MAY EXPERIENCE AN
  INTERRUPTION OR LOSS OF SERVICES, AND COMPANY SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR
  ANY THIRD PARTY REGARDING THE SAME.
</div>
<br />
<div>
  IN ADDITION, COMPANY MAY PARTICIPATE IN “RECURRING BILLING PROGRAMS” OR
  “ACCOUNT UPDATER SERVICES” SUPPORTED BY YOUR CREDIT CARD PROVIDER (AND
  ULTIMATELY DEPENDENT ON YOUR BANK’S PARTICIPATION). IF WE ARE UNABLE TO
  SUCCESSFULLY CHARGE YOUR EXISTING PAYMENT METHOD, YOUR CREDIT CARD PROVIDER
  (OR YOUR BANK) MAY NOTIFY US OF UPDATES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD NUMBER AND/OR
  EXPIRATION DATE, OR THEY MAY AUTOMATICALLY CHARGE YOUR NEW CREDIT CARD ON OUR
  BEHALF WITHOUT NOTIFICATION TO US. IN ACCORDANCE WITH RECURRING BILLING
  PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS, IN THE EVENT THAT WE ARE NOTIFIED OF AN UPDATE TO YOUR
  CREDIT CARD NUMBER AND/OR EXPIRATION DATE, COMPANY WILL AUTOMATICALLY UPDATE
  YOUR PAYMENT PROFILE ON YOUR BEHALF. COMPANY MAKES NO GUARANTEES THAT WE WILL
  REQUEST OR RECEIVE UPDATED CREDIT CARD INFORMATION. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE
  THAT IT IS YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO MODIFY AND MAINTAIN YOUR ACCOUNT
  SETTINGS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO (I) CANCELLING PRODUCTS AND (II)
  ENSURING YOUR ASSOCIATED PAYMENT METHOD(S) ARE CURRENT AND VALID. FURTHER, YOU

  If for any reason Company is unable to charge your Payment Method for the full
  amount owed, or if Company receives notification of a chargeback, reversal,
  payment dispute, or is charged a penalty for any fee it previously charged to
  your Payment Method, you agree that Company may pursue all available lawful
  remedies in order to obtain payment, including but not limited to, immediate
  cancellation, without notice to you, of any domain names or Services
  registered or renewed on your behalf. Company also reserves the right to
  charge you reasonable “administrative” fees" for (i) tasks Company may perform
  outside the normal scope of its Services, (ii) additional time and/or costs
  Company may incur in providing its Services, and/or (iii) your noncompliance
  with this Agreement (as determined by Company in its sole and absolute
  discretion). Typical administrative or processing fee scenarios include, but
  are not limited to (i) customer service issues that require additional
  personal time or attention; (ii) UDRP actions(s) in connection with your
  domain name(s) and/or disputes that require accounting or legal services,
  whether performed by Company staff or by outside firms retained by Company;
  (iii) recouping any and all costs and fees, including the cost of Services,
  incurred by Company as the results of chargebacks or other payment disputes
  brought by you, your bank or Payment Method processor. These administrative
  fees or processing fees will be billed to the Payment Method you have on file
  with Company.
</div>
<br />
<div>
  Company may offer product-level pricing in various currencies. The transaction
  will be processed in the selected currency and the pricing displayed during
  the checkout process will be the actual amount submitted for payment. For
  certain Payment Methods, the issuer of your Payment Method may charge you a
  foreign transaction fee or other charge, which may be added to the final
  amount that appears on your bank statement or post as a separate amount.
  Please check with the issuer of your Payment Method for details. In addition,
  regardless of the selected currency, you acknowledge and agree that you may be
  charged Value Added Tax ("VAT"), Goods and Services Tax ("GST"), or other
  localized fees and/or taxes, based on your bank and/or the country indicated
  in your billing address section.

<div>
  (B) In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, Title 17
  of the United States Code, Section 512 (“DMCA”), we will respond promptly to
  claims of copyright infringement that are reported to the agent that we have
  designated to receive notifications of claims infringement (its “Designated

  that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of
  perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive
  right that is allegedly infringed.

<br />
<div>
  We will investigate notices of copyright infringement and take appropriate
  actions under the DMCA. Inquiries that do not follow this procedure may not
  receive a response.

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<div class="section">13. CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION AND VENUE</div>
<br />
<div>
  These Terms of Use shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State
  of Nebraska without regard to its conflict of laws rules. Any legal
  proceedings against Company that may arise out of, relate to, or be in any way
  connected with our Website, Application, Services or these Terms of Use shall
  be brought exclusively in the state and federal courts of the State of
  Nebraska and you waive any jurisdictional, venue, or inconvenient forum
  objections to such courts.
</div>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<div class="section">14. DISPUTE RESOLUTION & MANDATORY ARBITRATION</div>
<br />
<div>
  (A) We each agree to first contact each other with any disputes and provide a
  written description of the problem, all relevant documents/information and the
  proposed resolution. You agree to contact us with disputes by contacting us at
  the address provided in these Terms of Use. We will contact you based on the
  contact information you have provided us.
</div>
<br />
<div>
  (B) If after 30 days the parties are unable to resolve any dispute raised
  under the previous provision, the dispute may be submitted to arbitration
  consistent with this Section. The parties understand that they would have had
  a right or opportunity to litigate disputes through a court and to have a
  judge or jury decide their case, but they choose to have any disputes resolved
  through arbitration.
</div>
<br />
<div>
  (C) We each agree that any claim or dispute between us, and any claim by
  either of us against any agent, employee, successor, or assign of the other,
  including, to the full extent permitted by applicable law, third parties who
  are not signatories to this agreement, whether related to this agreement or
  otherwise, including past, present, and future claims and disputes, and
  including any dispute as to the validity or applicability of this arbitration
  clause, shall be resolved by binding arbitration administered by the JAMS
  under its rules and procedures in effect when the claim is filed. The rules
  and procedures and other information, including information on fees, may be
  obtained from JAMS’ website
  <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/">(www.jamsadr.com).</a>
  or by calling JAMS at 949-224-1810.
</div>
<br />
<div>
  (D) We are entering into this arbitration agreement in connection with a
  transaction involving interstate commerce. Accordingly, this arbitration
  agreement and any proceedings thereunder shall be governed by the Federal
  Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16. Any award by the arbitrator(s) may
  be entered as a judgment in any court having jurisdiction.
</div>
<br />
<div>
  (E) Exception to Arbitrate. Either of us may bring qualifying claims in small
  claims court. Further, as set forth below, we each agree that any arbitration
  will be solely between you and Company, not as part of a class wide claim
  (i.e., not brought on behalf of or together with another individual's claim).
  If for any reason any court or arbitrator holds that this restriction is
  unconscionable or unenforceable, then our agreement to arbitrate doesn't apply
  and the class wide dispute must be brought in court.
</div>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<div class="section">15. NO CLASS ACTIONS</div>
<br />
<div>
  TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PURSUE DISPUTES ON A
  CLASS WIDE BASIS; THAT IS, TO EITHER JOIN A CLAIM WITH THE CLAIM OF ANY OTHER
  PERSON OR ENTITY, OR ASSERT A CLAIM IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF

<div>
  We care about your privacy. For this reason, we collect and use personal
  information only as needed to deliver our products, services, websites and
  mobile applications, and to communicate with you about the same, or as you
  have requested (collectively, our “Services”). Your personal information
  includes information such as:
</div>

<div class="body-text">
  <ul>
    <li>Name</li>
    <li>Address</li>
    <li>Telephone number</li>

    <li>Candidate information (for job applicants)</li>

<div>
  Our Privacy Policy not only explains how and why we use your personal
  information that we collect, but also how you can access, update or otherwise
  take control of your personal information.
</div>
<br />
<div>
  If at any time you have questions about our practices or any of your rights
  described below, you may reach our Data Protection Officer (“DPO”) and our
  dedicated team that supports this office by contacting us at

  This inbox is actively monitored and managed so that we can deliver an

<br />
<br />
<div>
  <b>What information we collect, how we collect it, and why</b>
</div>
<br />
<br />
<div>
  Much of what you likely consider personal information is collected directly
  from you when you:
  <ul>
    <li>
      create an account or purchase any of our Services (ex: billing
      information, including name, address, credit card number);
    </li>
    <li>
      request assistance from our award-winning customer support team (ex: phone
      number);
    </li>
    <li>
      complete contact forms or request newsletters or other information from us
      (ex: email); or
    </li>
    <li>
      participate in contests and surveys, apply for a job, or otherwise
      participate in activities we promote that might require information about
      you.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div>
  However, we also collect additional information when delivering our Services
  to you to ensure necessary and optimal performance. These methods of
  collection may not be as obvious to you, so we thought we’d highlight and
  explain a bit more about what these might be (as they vary from time to time):
</div>
<br />
<br />
<div>
  <b>Cookies and similar technologies</b>
  on our websites and our mobile applications allow us to track your browsing
  behavior, links clicked, items purchased, your device type, and to collect
  various data, including analytics, about how you use and interact with our
  Services. These technologies automatically collect data when you use and
  interact with our Services, including metadata, log files, cookie/device IDs,
  page load time, server response time, and approximate location information to
  measure website performance and improve our systems, including optimizing DNS
  resolution, network routing and server configurations. Specifically,
  interactions with the features, content and links (including those of
  third-parties, such as social media plugins) contained within the Services,
  Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type and settings, the date and time
  the Services were used, information about browser configuration and plugins,
  language preferences and cookie data, information about devices accessing the
  Services, including type of device, what operating system is used, device
  settings, application IDs, unique device identifiers and error data is
  collected. All this allows us to provide you with more relevant product
  offerings, a better experience on our sites and mobile applications, and to
  collect, analyze and improve the performance of our Services. We may also
  collect your location (IP address) so that we can personalize our Services.

<div>
  <b>Supplemented Data</b>
  may be received about you from other sources, including publicly available
  databases or third parties from whom we have purchased data, in which case we
  may combine this data with information we already have about you so that we
  can update, expand and analyze the accuracy of our records, assess the
  qualifications of a candidate for employment, identify new customers, and
  provide products and services that may be of interest to you. If you provide
  us personal information about others, or if others give us your information,
  we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was
  provided to us.
</div>
<br />
<br />
<div>
  <b>How we utilize information.</b>
</div>
<br />
<br />
<div>
  We strongly believe in both minimizing the data we collect and limiting its
  use and purpose to only that (1) for which we have been given permission, (2)
  as necessary to deliver the Services you purchase or interact with, or (3) as
  we might be required or permitted for legal compliance or other lawful
  purposes:
</div>
<br />
<br />
<div>
  <b>Delivering, improving, updating and enhancing our Services.</b>
  We collect various information relating to your purchase, use and/or
  interactions with our Services. We utilize this information to:
</div>
<br />
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Improve and optimize the operation and performance of our Services (again,
      including our websites and mobile applications)
    </li>
    <li>
      Diagnose problems with and identify any security and compliance risks,
      errors, or needed enhancements to the Services
    </li>
    <li>Detect and prevent fraud and abuse of our Services and systems</li>
    <li>Collecting aggregate statistics about use of the Services</li>
    <li>
      Understand and analyze how you use our Services and what products and
      services are most relevant to you.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
<br />
<div>
  Much of the data collected is aggregated or statistical data about how
  individuals use our Services, and is not linked to any personal information.
</div>
<br />
<br />
<div>
  <b>Sharing with trusted third parties.</b>
  We may share your personal information with third parties that we have
  partnered to allow you to integrate their services into our own Services, and
  with our affiliates or trusted third party service providers as necessary for
  them to perform services on our behalf, such as:
</div>
<br />

<div>
  <ul>
    <li>Processing credit card payments</li>
    <li>Serving advertisements</li>
    <li>Conducting contests or surveys</li>
    <li>Performing analysis of our Services and customers demographics</li>
    <li>Communicating with you, such as by way email or survey delivery</li>
    <li>Customer relationship management</li>
    <li>Security risk management and compliance</li>
    <li>Recruiting support and related services.</li>
  </ul>

      or
    </li>
    <li>
      if we sell, buy, merge, are acquired by, or partner with other companies
      or businesses, or sell some or all of our assets. In such transactions,
      your information may be among the transferred assets.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <br />
  <b>Communicating with you.</b>
  We may contact you directly or through a third party service provider
  regarding products or services you have signed up or purchased from us, such
  as necessary to deliver transactional or service related communications. We
  may also contact you with offers for additional services we think you’ll find
  valuable if you give us consent, or where allowed based upon legitimate

  <br />
  If we collect information from you in connection with a co-branded offer, it
  will be clear at the point of collection who is collecting the information and
  whose privacy policy applies. In addition, it will describe any choice options
  you have in regards to the use and/or sharing of your personal information
  with a co-branded partner, as well as how to exercise those options. We are
  not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of third-party sites.
  Please read the privacy policy of any website you visit.
</div>
<br />
<br />
<div>
  If you make use of a service that allows you to import contacts (ex. using
  email marketing services to send emails on your behalf), we will only use the
  contacts and any other personal information for the requested service. If you
  believe that anyone has provided us with your personal information and you
  would like to request that it be removed from our database, please contact us

  <b>Transfer of personal information abroad.</b>
  If you utilize our Services from a country other than the country where our
  servers are located, your personal information may be transferred across
  international borders, which will only be done when necessary for the
  performance of our contract with you, when we have your consent to do so, or
  when the appropriate standard contractual clauses are in place. Also, when you
  call us or initiate a chat, we may provide you with support from one of our
  global locations outside your country of origin.
</div>
<br />
<br />
<div>
  <b>Compliance with legal, regulatory and law enforcement requests.</b>
  We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties
  to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you
  to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our
  sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and
  legal process (such as subpoena requests), to protect our property and rights
  or the property and rights of a third party, to protect the safety of the
  public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal
  or unethical.
</div>
<br />
<br />
<div>
  To the extent we are legally permitted to do so, we will take reasonable steps
  to notify you in the event that we are required to provide your personal
  information to third parties as part of legal process. We will also share your
  information to the extent necessary to comply with any ICANN, registry or
  ccTLD rules, regulations and policies when you register a domain name with us.
  For reasons critical to maintaining the security, stability and resiliency of
  the Internet, this includes the transfer of domain name registration
  information to the underlying domain registry operator and escrow provider,
  and publication of that information as required by ICANN in the public WHOIS
  database or with other third parties that demonstrate a legitimate legal
  interest to such information.

  participants as to what “Do Not Track” means in this context. Like many
  websites and online services, we currently do not alter our practices when we
  receive a “Do Not Track” signal from a visitor’s browser. To find out more
